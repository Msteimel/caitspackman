		<p>I’ve been an artist for as long as I can remember. I’m a painter, a sculptor, a writer, and a seamstress. But I love photography most. I love turning real moments and real people into art.</p>
		<p>I’m also a giant nerd. I have a degree in medieval literature, an undying love for fantasy and sci fi novels, and a cat named Pippin. I drink way too much coffee and a barely appropriate amount of tea. My boyfriend is beyond exasperated with all of the herbs I keep bringing home to our apartment to repot into antique bakeware on our windowsill.</p>

	<h1>About Her Work</h1>
	 <p>My background in painting and drawing—two years of formal apprenticeship to an artist, and a lifetime of practice—gives me a unique approach to photography. I put all of my knowledge of composition and color theory into each photograph, with the goal of producing a cohesive and beautiful vignette with each shot. I have a great affinity for dynamic place; I choose each location for my shoots carefully, so that my images will be vibrant and full of life not just in the foreground, but in the background as well.</p>
	 <p>I want each photo to capture a real laugh, an authentic smile, a genuine kiss. I try to avoid the overly posed element in my work, because that spark that makes a photograph come to life can’t be faked. I will tell you jokes, I will bring bubbles and toys, I will ask you to tell your loved ones just how much they mean to you.</p>
	 <p>That’s what makes each of my photographs a genuine moment of joy.</p>
